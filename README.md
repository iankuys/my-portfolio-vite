# My Website

Welcome to the source code for my personal website — a fast, modern frontend built with:

- **React.js**
- **TailwindCSS**
- **Vite**
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**

The site is currently deployed and hosted on **[Vercel](https://ianku.vercel.app/)** for speed and reliability.

## Features

- Responsive design with TailwindCSS
- Lightning-fast development with Vite + HMR
- Clean, minimal UI built for performance and clarity
- Deployed with zero-config via Vercel

## Structure

The codebase follows a modular structure, making it easy to expand and maintain. Key folders:

- `src/` — main app logic and components
- `public/` — static assets
- `vite.config.js` — project configuration
